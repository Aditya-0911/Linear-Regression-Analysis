## Overview

This Python script performs linear regression analysis with coefficient insights. It's designed for ease of use, taking a CSV dataset and user-defined regression equation as input. The script calculates regression coefficients, p-values, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared, offering valuable insights into relationships between variables.  
The equation used in calculating coefficients is known as Normal Equation for Linear Regression

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted with a header row and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Model Definition**: Input the regression equation using Patsy syntax when prompted.

3. **Results**: Get coefficient details, p-values, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared printed to the console.

While suitable for basic analysis, consider specialized libraries like scikit-learn or statsmodels for advanced statistics. Ensure your dataset is well-formatted and you understand the regression equation. Learn more about Patsy syntax in the [documentation](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formulas.html).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `patsy`: For working with data formulas.
- `scipy`: For scientific computing and statistical functions.
- `scikit-learn`: For linear regression using scikit-learn's `linear_model` module.
- `statsmodels`: For linear regression using both the formula API (`formula.api`) and the standard API (`api`).

## Credit Dataset (ISL)

The Credit dataset provided by ISL (Introduction to Statistical Learning) serves as an excellent educational resource and illustrative dataset in the realm of statistical learning and machine learning. This dataset typically contains information about credit applicants and is used to demonstrate various statistical and machine learning concepts.

**Key Characteristics of the Credit Dataset:**

- **Attributes**: The dataset typically includes a variety of attributes or features that describe each credit applicant. These attributes may include information such as age, income, credit score, education level, and more.

- **Response Variable**: The dataset often includes a response variable that indicates whether a credit application was approved or denied. This binary response variable makes the dataset suitable for binary classification tasks.

**Access the Credit Dataset:**
- You can download the [Credit dataset](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-python) from the ISL website.
- You can also get the dataset provided in the repository 

The Credit dataset from ISL provides a valuable hands-on experience for individuals learning about data analysis, machine learning, and credit risk assessment. It demonstrates how real-world datasets can be used to make informed decisions and manage risk effectively in financial applications.
